# What is this ?

I was never happy with printf style logs, you rarely know at first what you need to put in them and how to format
them so you just drop a ruby logger and log anything. Your log messages quickly become a huge mess unless you
revise all of them when the project matures and this is a real pain...

Since I discovered logstash I started to think about what I would expect from an intelligent ruby logger allowing
me to embed the actual context of the log message WITH the message and not inside it so the informations can
easily be extracted without stupid operations like regexp matching.

I first found radar which does something similar but aimed at exception catching then I recently found ruby-cabin,
after some considerations I decided to try rolling out my own, I opened a text file and in 10min I had a basic
prototype and here we are !

# Simple example

```ruby
<%= File.read('examples/basic.rb') %>

```


# Features

## Contexts

You can define hash keys and their values, they will be included in any log
sent within the block.

``` ruby
<%= File.read('examples/hash_context.rb') %>

```

## Nested contexts

You can use nested contexts in this case the inner contexts have a higher priority over
the ones above if they define the same keys.

``` ruby
<%= File.read('examples/nested_context.rb') %>

```


## Dymanic context

In some cases it may be more handy to use a class rather than a static hash, for
example if use the thread local variables to store the user, session or anything.

``` ruby
<%= File.read('examples/dynamic_context.rb') %>

```

## Threads and Fibers friendly

Whether you use threads or fibers for concurrency you are good to go, the contexts are
store with Thread.current which is local to the current fiber (thread's root fiber if not using
Fiber explicitly).

``` ruby
<%= File.read('examples/threads.rb') %>

```
